☕ Java Learning Log

Duration: August – November 2025

A detailed timeline of my Java learning journey — covering core concepts, object-oriented programming, collections, and database integration.

📘 August 11–13, 2025
🔹 Version Control Basics

Set up Git Bash and learned to use it for version control.

Understood the differences between Git, Git Bash, and GitHub.

Practiced essential Git commands: init, add, commit, push, clone, etc.

Followed best practices for maintaining clean repositories.

Solved basic Java problems to strengthen logical foundations.

📗 August 18–20, 2025
🔹 Java Fundamentals

Started learning Java programming basics.

Studied syntax, keywords, data types, and variables.

Understood the structure of a Java program, including the main() method and program flow.

Practiced simple input/output programs to build familiarity with the Java development environment.

📙 August 25–27, 2025
🔹 Control Flow and Arrays

Learned about conditional and looping statements: if, else, switch, while, for, do-while.

Understood the importance of decision-making and iteration.

Studied arrays (1D and 2D) — declaration, initialization, and traversal.

Implemented programs using nested loops for matrix and array-based operations.

📘 September 1–3, 2025
🔹 Methods and Strings

Explored methods — definition, parameters, return types, and modular programming.

Studied Strings, their immutability, and manipulation techniques.

Learned about StringBuffer and StringBuilder for efficient string operations.

Compared String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder for performance and use cases.

📗 September 8–10, 2025
🔹 Introduction to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

Understood key OOP concepts: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

Studied constructors (default, parameterized, copy).

Learned the difference between instance and static variables.

Explored access modifiers (public, private, protected, default) and their scopes.

Implemented inheritance to create class hierarchies.

📙 September 15–17, 2025
🔹 Advanced OOP Concepts

Deep dive into Encapsulation, Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Polymorphism.

Practiced Method Overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and Method Overriding (runtime polymorphism).

Learned Upcasting and Downcasting with practical examples.

Implemented Abstract Classes and Interfaces to enhance modular design.

📘 September 22–24, 2025
🔹 Applying OOP Concepts

Solved real-life Java problems using OOP principles.

Strengthened understanding of inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

Focused on writing clean, reusable, and modular code simulating real-world scenarios.

📗 October 13–15, 2025
🔹 Interfaces and Functional Programming

Completed the topic of Interfaces in Java.

Learned about Functional Interfaces, Default Methods, Static Methods, and Marker Interfaces.

Understood Lambda Expressions for concise, functional-style Java code.

Implemented practical examples using Interfaces + Lambda Expressions.

📙 October 27–29, 2025
🔹 Packages, Exceptions, and Wrapper Classes

Studied Packages — purpose, creation, and import mechanisms.

Learned Exception Handling (try, catch, finally, throw, throws).

Understood checked vs. unchecked exceptions and created custom exceptions.

Explored Wrapper Classes and concepts of autoboxing and unboxing.

Built practical programs combining packages, exception handling, and wrapper classes.

📘 November 3–5, 2025
🔹 Generics, Collections, and JDBC

Learned Generics for writing type-safe and reusable code.

Studied the Collections Framework — List, Set, Queue, and Map.

Practiced implementations: ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, and TreeMap.

Integrated Generics with Collections for type safety.

Studied JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) — architecture and database integration.

Practiced CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using JDBC with MySQL.

Understood roles of DriverManager, Connection, Statement, and ResultSet classes.

🚀 Key Takeaways

Built a strong foundation in Core Java and OOP concepts.

Learned how to structure, optimize, and maintain Java projects efficiently.

Gained hands-on experience with Git, Collections, and Database Connectivity.

Developed an industry-ready understanding of Java application development.th MySQL  
- Understood the role of *DriverManager, **Connection, **Statement, and **ResultSet* classes in database interaction
